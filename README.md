## Purpose:
The Train Ticket Booking System website allows an easy way for customer-facing staff at Singapore High-Speed Intercontinental Railway to book train tickets for passengers at the front-desk or over the phone.

## Instructions:
To execute the code, user will need to download the zip file, open the terminal to the main folder, and run the following commands:
-  `npm install`
-  `npm install --save-dev @babel/core@7 @babel/cli@7`
-  `node_modules/.bin/babel --version`
-  `npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react@7`
-  `npx babel src --presets @babel/react --out-dir public`
-  `npm run watch`
-	Then open a second terminal, and run `npm start`

Afterwards, the staff should be able to access the website, where they can help travellers to book tickets, delete tickets, display ticket information in a list, and display free seats in a graphical format.
